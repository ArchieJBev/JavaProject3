In this project, there is a matrix file where there are some basic functions implemented, this file is used to have subclasses linked to it. 
The general matrix class creates a matrix of any dimensions with non zero entries.
The tri matrix class creates a tridiagonal matrix. 
In the two classes above there is an LU decomposition method implemented so that any matrix can be decomposed into the multiplication of an upper and lower diagonal matrix, this helps for the determinant.
The project 3 class calculates some simple statistics on random matrices (matrices where the entries are randomly generated).
